## Building
To build the library you'll need to use Grunt. First install the required node modules ([grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) must be installed):
```
git clone https://github.com/tanhdmt/ContentTools.git
cd ContentTools
npm install
```

Install Sass (if not already installed):
```
gem install sass (install Ruby to use gem command)
```

Then run `grunt build` to build the project
